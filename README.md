# AoC-Haskell

It is a long term goal of mine to develop beautifull haskell solutions to as many Advent of Code questions as I have time for. I will put them here over time.

The length of imports is pretty unwieldy and I will look into other prelude's but for now I have placed all imports used in the imports.hs file and will be leaving them out of my haskell code
